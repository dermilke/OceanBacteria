# _OceanBacteria_

## Exploring Ocean Bacterioplankton Communities

This app is designed to explore the global bacterioplankton dataset aquired during several cruises along longitudinal transects in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. The repository only contains a sample dataset from the original one, including a sample and its environmental data. 

The app is designed to run as a shiny-server application, using R (version 3.6.1) and the pacakges Shiny (version 1.4.0), ShinyWidgets (version 0.5.1) and the tidyverse package (version 1.3.0). This code has been published to show the implementation of how the data was visualized.
